This is a website where users can add websites that they think are cool and want others to know about. Based on how the website is perceived by other users, the website will either gain votes or be removed from the site. 

The main tech "stack" is React with Next.JS, Supabase for backend, and Vercel for deployment.

I tried to add some responsive design so the website would look fine on mobile devices as well as on tablets and computers.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
